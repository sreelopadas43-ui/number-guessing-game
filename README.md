# number-guessing-game
The Number Guessing Game is a Python program where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number, and the game provides hints like “Too High” or “Too Low” until the correct guess is made. It also counts the number of attempts and allows the player to play multiple rounds or exit anytime.
